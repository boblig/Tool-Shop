About
-----
This is a simple MVC website that I made for a course four years ago. It's not perfect but we all have to start somewhere.
Due to time constraints images and JavaScript were cut. I'm proud of its simplicity though and overengineered MVC websites
are something I find distasteful. To me that ruins the whole point and advantage OOP and MVC bring and makes your code
hard to read.

Things that can be improved
---------------------------
* Folders and subfolders could be obtained automatically instead of being listed manually.
* I was still learning MVC architecture at the time so there's a fair bit of confusion between Models and Controllers.
* I did not make use of prepared statements.
* I did not make a full use of views. Again I was learning MVC architecture at the time.

Permissions
-----------
The autoloader and the router which are a heart and soul of this project are nabbed from a tutorial I saw online. If it
weren't for free and open source software I would have never made this. I'm a firm supporter of open source software
and I wish it was an industry standard. I found it especially inspiring when someone like John Carmack who revolutionized
3D graphics multiple times open sourced everything. You don't gain anything by jealously guarding your creation.

As far as permission goes you are free to do whatever you want with this project. You don't have to ask me for permission
or credit me. Again, if it weren't for someone else I wouldn't have done this entirely on my own. And I hope that in the
future as I get better I keep this a standard for all my code.
