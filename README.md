About
-----
This is a simple MVC website that I made for a course four years ago. It's not perfect but we all have to start somewhere.
Due to time constraints images and JavaScript were cut. I'm proud of its simplicity though and overengineered MVC websites
are something I find distasteful. To me that ruins the whole point and advantage OOP and MVC bring and makes your code
hard to read.

Things that can be improved
---------------------------
* Folders and subfolders could be obtained automatically instead of being listed manually.
* I was still learning MVC architecture at the time so there's a fair bit of confusion between Models and Controllers.
* I did not make use of prepared statements.
* I did not make a full use of views. Again I was learning MVC architecture at the time.
